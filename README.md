# CargoShip-no-scientists-bug-fix
Rust Oxide plugin fixing cargo ship spawned with no scientists

Rust (game) Oxide plugin fixing CargoShip spawned with no scientists. On some Rust maps (modded with Oxide) CargoShip spawns out of liveable map and all scientists die immediately. This plugin can fix this issue.

If CargoShip spawned out of liveable area then the plugin kills the object and creates new one just on the map borders.

UPDATE: the cause seems to be Oxide.Ext.RustIO.dll (Rust.IO maps). Anyway this plugin can fix the issue
